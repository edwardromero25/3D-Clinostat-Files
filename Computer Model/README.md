## Microgravity Simulation Computer Model
This project is a Python-based computer model that predicts the acceleration vector of a sample in a 3D clinostat, which assists scientists in determining the combination of inner and outer frame velocities that produce the best microgravity simulation.

## Built With

[![Python][python-logo]](https://www.python.org/)

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. In `dataCompile.py`, set:
   - The time period of analysis (lines 16–17)
   - The inner and outer frame velocities (lines 38–39)

2. To start the simulation, run:
   ```bash
   python3 dataCompile.py
   ```
