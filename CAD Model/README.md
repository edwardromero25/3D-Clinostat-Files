Fusion 360 was used to generate the designs for the 3D clinostat v2 (A), and the sample holders (B-D) that
slide into the inner frame. The sample holder shown on the clinostat (A) can carry a cell culture flask with an
area of 25 cm<sup>2</sup> (T25) and a flaskette on each side. It is necessary to balance the weight on each side of the
holder. The HARV holder can carry two HARVs (B) and air flow to the membrane on the lower side of the
HARV is not restricted due to the design of the holder. The T25 holder (C) can carry a T25 cell culture flask
on each side of the holder, and the flaskette holder (D) can carry two flaskettes on each side. The samples
are attached with zip ties using the holes in the holder.
